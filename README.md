# rw-engineering-exploration
A project for learning how to write code in rust, as well as mapping out some basic features which may be needed in the rw-engineering website.

In this project many lower level features are also created from scratch for the purpose of better understanding them.

## WARNING

This project is not ready for use. The primary purpose of this project is research and as such it is lacking many features particularly in the field of security. Although a simple authentication system is implemented there are multiple insecurities remaining.

## Tools used

This project used the following tools:

1. Rust
2. Docker
3. Google Cloud
4. MongoDB
